Seed instructions:

1. Install node-fetch if you don't have it locally:
   npm install node-fetch@2

2. Run the script to fetch Fake Store API and write a generated JSON file:
   node scripts/fetch-fakestore-and-write.js

This will create `src/data/generated-shop-data.json`. You can then import or merge it into your app as needed.
